# Schema Infos

Scheme need to be 'mergeed' (ie: `<<` to be process) for `yaml-language-server` to be able to use the schema as a template.

When modifying a schema here, run `update.sh` to update exported schemas in `./generated/` directory.
To run the `update.sh`, you need to have `yq` install on your system.
